pympress
========

A simple dual-screen PDF reader designed for presentations

To summarize, the current branch requires
-----------------------------------

Mandatory:
1. Python GTK+-3.0 (including GObject and Poppler bindings)
2. GIR poppler, e.g. gir1.2-poppler-0.18 (GObject introspection data for poppler-glib). This may need to be installed separately from other python GTK+-3.0 bindings

Optional:
1. PyAudio. You need it if you would like to hear sound notifications in the course of showing your presentation with pympress
