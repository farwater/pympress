To summarize, the current branch requires
-----------------------------------

Mandatory:
1. Python GTK+-3.0 (including GObject and Poppler bindings)
2. GIR poppler (GObject introspection data for poppler-glib). This may need to be installed separately from other python GTK+-3.0 bindings

Optional:
